Today is May 2025, in the midst of Trump's new trade war against the People's Republic of China.

The most relevant historical parallel is the <b>Roman-Persian Wars</b> — the greatest rivalry of Classical Antiquity.

Lasting for over 700 years (54 BC - 628 AD), these wars were fought intermittently for nearly the entire
existence of both the Roman and Persian Empires respectively.


### Rome

Rome needs no introduction, particularly to Western audiences.

For our purposes, I would like to highlight <b> 3 key moments </b> in Roman history that may be of interest to this conversation.

**509 BC:** Marcus Junius Brutus overthrows the last King of Rome, establishing the **Roman Republic**.

**27 BC:**  Augustus becomes the first emperor, marking the creation of the  **Roman Empire**.

**184 AD:**  Diocletian reunites the empire, adopting a more absolute form of rule known as the **Dominate**.

What we can see in Roman history, is the story of an idealistic nation that was constantly struggling with its own political identity. The conflict between liberty and autocracy, between chaos and stability, proved to be a constant point of tension as the empire grew and extended itself to cover the entire Mediterranean basin.

Ultimately, Roman liberty collapsed and gave way to absolute imperial rule


### Persia

Iran, historically known as <i>Persia</i> to Western audiences, had long been one of the oldest continuous civilizations in human history.



<b> 330 BC: </b> Alexander the Great conquers and ends the Persian <b> Achaemenid Empire </b>. <br><br>

<b> 247 BC: </b> Arsaces I rebels against Greek rule and establishes the <b>Parthian Empire</b>. <br><br>

<b> 224 AD: </b> Ardashir I rebels against the Parthians and establishes the <b>Sassanian Empire</b>.

Persian history is a model of cultural continuity and resilience. Every time it is beset by foreign invasions

It is also the story of Persian chauvinism — the belief that its divinely ordained ruler, the <i> Shahanshah </i>, is the supreme ruler of the known world and the other nations are nothing more than tributaries or vassals.


### Conflict

As the two most powerful empires in Western Eurasia at the time, Rome and Persia were always in conflict for hegemony over their region. For context, here is a shortlist of just a few of these wars:

Needless to say, Rome and Persia came to see each other as their most formidable rival over centuries of conflict, with one Persian Shah referring to the two nations as the "Two Eyes of the World." This geopolitical conflict was exacerbated by intense <b>cultural conflict</b> as well, with each empire viewing itself as the superior model for a nation to govern itself.

Rome was proud of what it saw as its superior moral values, such as liberty, law, and virtue. <br>
Persia was proud of its ancient culture and history, centered on its native religion of Zoroastrianism.

Rome was known for its ability to stage miraculous comebacks. <br>
Persia was known for its incredible continuity and resilience.

Rome was a republic with elected officials — which eventually morphed into a authoritarian imperial system. <br>
Persia was an absolute theocratic monarchy.

Do you see the parallels yet?


### Trump


In this context, how should we view the Trump presidency?

On one hand, it's reasonable to view 2025 as the turning point where the American Republic and its institutions crumbled, giving way to an <b>American Dominate</b> of sorts. The collapse of America's classical republican values is clear.

If Trump seeks a third term in 2028 — or, as is more likely, is killed or interrupted from doing so — then the parallels to the Caesarian
moment will be complete. In other



### How It Ends

So, who won the greatest power struggle of Classical Antiquity? Rome or Persia?

The answer is... neither.

The final of these fated wars, the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628'>Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628</a>, ended with both empires depleted and exhausted — at the worst possible time.

In the 7th century AD, an Arab prophet named Muhammad began preaching a new religion known today as Islam—and the newly
unified Arab tribes launched a massive invasion against both empires. The Romans and Persians, both exhausted from years of warfare,
could only mount a faint resistance as the newly established Islamic caliphate conquered most of their most valuable lands.

The Sassanian Empire was completely destroyed by the invading Muslim armies of that time, while the Romans managed to survive for a few
more centuries as a crippled shell of its former self, eventually shrinking to the point of only controlling its capital city of Constantinople.

So what does this mean for the US and China?

My prediction is that the US-China conflict — which will undoubtedly dominate the next few decades of world affairs — will end with both nations trading hits back and forth, ultimately exhausting each other until new powers take their place.

The hard truth is: they simply cannot defeat each other.

But again: this is all just the rambling of a random guy on the internet. Take it with a grain of salt.
