1 year ago, I quit my job and came back home.

My original goal was to write a comic book — which I finished 1 chapter of, and then promptly realized this was a bad idea.

Also, as a Google News app addict, it was hard to turn away from the fact that the tech / AI space has been so active these days and it was hard to look away from all the action. Was I really going to spend this time trying to eek away 1 page of a comic book per day when the entire world was changing all around me?


### Pandemonium

My original comic idea was called [Pandemonium](pandemonium), and it was a fusion of several different ancient Asian classic novels. I had a really big Three Kingdoms / Journey to the West phase in 2023, so it was only natural for me that I try my hand at creating the epic story that's always been lurking around in my head.

I got pretty far with the outline — but the experience of writing that first 40-page chapter over 1 month was a very good learning experience as to why more peple don't attempt comics. It's a pretty intensive operation, especially when you're as perfectionistic as I am.


### Samhan

So after a few weeks of that, I turned my attention toward another comic idea.

I've always loved the K-Drama [Queen Seondeok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Seondeok_(TV_series)), which briefly covers the Unification Wars in Korea from 642-668 AD. It's always been a personal fascination of mine, and it seemed similar enough to my original Pandemonium idea that I thought it was worth a shot.

I did finish the [concept art](kingdom) and story outline for the comic, and I do plan on finishing it one day. 

However, I think starting it now may be a waste of effort, given how quickly AI-driven creation is taking hold. Maybe I'll wait a few years until that technology matures and I can finally go ahead with the comic studio of my dreams.


### Stanley

Yes, I did kind of end up working for Stan again. But I had two good reasons:

**1) Money**

Stan pays very well. I made $100,000 during my gap year in contract work, which is almost on-par with what I was making as a full-time employee.

**2) AI**

I had gotten tired of working on Stan Store's "core" SaaS product, but John & Vitalii had a fun [14-day sprint](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitddnv_today-were-celebrating-stanley-your-content-activity-7391459262381867008-0yGp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADA8kmMBWerIUoZ1eY36BecScf1fUzVQCi0) where they flew to London to kick off the development of Stanley, their AI content creation product.

Rather than struggle with product development on my own, I figured it would be better to latch onto John & Vitalii since they know how to really get things off the ground.


### Sketchdreamer

I also started my own little project, which I am calling **Sketchdreamer.**

It originally started as a project to help with AI-assisted drawing, which is still in the works.

However, the core product is now called the **Portal** — an infinite canvas-based generative UI for the future of AI. Built on top of the Svelte Flow library.

To be honest, I'm kinda souring on the whole infinite canvas concept as a whole. I think it's great for actua design programs like Photoshop and Figma, but not great for normal everyday users because it requires too much manual brainpower to even understand.


### Conclusions

So, what did we learn from my gap year?

1) I do like the freedom of working from home, but it does get lonely after a while.

2) It's incredibly easy to fall back into laziness and comfort. I lost track of my goal several times while I've been here.

3) I'm starting to write more regularly as a method of keeping my sanity in check.
