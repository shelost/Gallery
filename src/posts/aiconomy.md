In the Late Bronze Age (~12th century BC), the leading civilizations of the era instituted what historians call a <a href =''> Palace Economy </a>. The Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt would collect all of the grain produced during each harvest to a large centralized grain stores, and would redistribute them to their populace to ensure sustainability.

In 2025, OpenAI's latest release, Sora 2, has recently hit the App Store with its ability to feature real-world people in its videos in a feature they're calling "Cameos."

What do these two things have to do with each other? Well, I believe they both offer their own glimpses what the future of an AI-driven economy would actually look like. 


## The Market

Look at this chart. It goes up very quickly.


Most of this exponential growth has come down to a singular invention: the market. The idea that 

The market has persisted this long because it offers a level of abstraction previously unheard of — you literally never need to know which farmer produced your feed, which factory work stitched your shirt, or which architect designed the house you live in.

They each simply got paid for their work, and some time later, you paid for each of these goods with the money you've made from your craft. 


## The Internet

The Internet is the "final form" of the market — even more abstraction, at even faster speeds, universally.

A great deal of how humans use the internet is for discovery. We're looking for something that suits our needs, whether it be simple entertainment or a specific piece of information. The most successful internet companies all take advantage of this central premise, building some combination of a **search engine** and a **discovery platform.**

- Google is the universal search engine for information.
- Amazon is a search + discovery + checkout for purchases.
- YouTube is a discovery platform for entertainment.
- Instagram and Facebook are search + discovery platform for social updates.

As fun as "surfing the web" may be, most people agree that it can be a waste of time + is simply a roadblock in the way of accomplishing our actual goal. Anyone who's ever tried to write a research paper will know how excruciating the research process acutally is. Why can't my sources ever cite themselves?

These apps are built on one simple principle: **the computer doesn't know what you want**, so here's an easy way to search through the entire repository of human knowledge in a matter of seconds.


But... what if it did?

As in... computers can now think and reason, and even search the internet to answer your questions.

Like an AI system that has been trained on the entire internet, and also your specific tastes.


## The Orb

For convenience, let's call this omniscient AI system "the Orb" — a universal repository of all work output produced by both humans and AI. 

Every film, research paper, painting, excel spreadsheet, NFT, and widget ever produced by a human will be uploaded directly into the Orb, similar to how we would upload a file into Google Drive today.

Then, whenever a human requires anything new to be created, they would simply ask the Orb to generate something tailored for their purposes.

## What This Means

Let's say that you're an artist.

Currently, your workflow probably looks something like this: 
- Create a piece of art
- Upload it to a discovery platform such as Behance, Dribbble or Etsy
- Hope that some wandering web-surfer discovers your work and decides to pay for it via a web commerce provider.

There's a great deal of manual discovery and searching in this process — which is all time which should instead be spent on you getting paid, and your customer on actually finding what they want more quickly.


- Create a piece of art
- Upload it to the Orb

In this scenario, 80% of the search-and-discover process has been removed — each party gets exactly what they want, as quickly as possible, with little to no friction in between.

The Orb becomes the **universal third buyer**, the <a href =''>market maker</a> who provides liquidity to all involved parties in the transaction.

## The Signs

We already have a few early signs into how — namely, with streaming platforms.

Whereas film studios and record labels used to sell the rights to movies & songs via a licensing agreement (e.g. Marvel sold the film rights to its most famous characters for around $50M), the rise of streaming platforms has slowly set a new standard when it comes to artist compensation.

Instead of getting $10M for the rights, Mariah Carey receives $0.003 every time someone streams "All I Want for Christmas is You" on Spotify. That may not seem like a lot, but over millions of streams (including corporate uses, which charge more), many people have earned quite a living through this streaming structure.

Imagine if every time someone generated another Studio Ghibli image via OpenAI, Hayao Miyazaki personally received 1/10 of a penny in royalty fees. Or whenever scenes from The Godfather are used as training data for a specific Sora 2 generation, the estate of the film crew receives 3/10 of a penny. 

It makes sense for the artists, who want to be compensated for their work.

It makes sense for the AI companies, who want to A) avoid expensive litigation, and B) ensure that *their* AI model handles 99% of all transactions in a given economic bloc. This would essentially mean that they are becoming a bank, public exchange market, and market maker all at the same time.

TL;DR — everyone will be a solo artist, receiving royalties from the Orb for their work.

The fundamentals of work remain the same: you get paid more if your work is popular, and less if it is not.

However, the difference is, you may never know whose work you're implicitly paying for, since they won't be a single. If your "Generate an image of a porcupine" prompt used 14% inspiration from National Geographic and 7% inspiration from the paintings of Vincent van Gogh, that's exactly how much each of them would be paid.


## The Losers

Anyone who makes money by taking advantage of market friction (as opposed to creation or consumption) is in for a rough ride.

Citadel, in addition to being a hedge fund, is the largest market maker in the United States, which means they make money by providing liquidity to the stock market. When you buy a share of GOOGL, you probably aren't buying from another investor who wants to sell. Instead, a market maker (such as Citadel) has bought a large amount of GOOGL from sellers, and then sells it back to you at the requested price.

Robinhood makes most of its money via Payment for Order Flow (PFOF), which

Amazon

Marketing as a profession would greatly be impacted, since it largely depends on making un-discovered products discoverable. After all, what use is a fancy ad campaign when the Orb already knows exactly what every single customer likes based on their history? I don't think the entire marketing industry will collapse, but it's reasonable to expect that it will mostly be replaced by search engine optimization (SEO), or more precisely, AI optimization (AIO)


## The Winners

OpenAI — wow, Sam Altman can't stop winning, can't he? Obviously, if there's a winner in this scenario, it would be the company which creates and controls the Orb. My bet is on OpenAI, if only for the fact that this entire AI boom has been primarily led by them from the beginning.
Maybe that's why he's planning to spend $1T+ on data centers...

Stripe is already one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, and their recent collaboration with OpenAI means that their technology will likely underwrite a large portion of the future AI economy for decades to come. Fast internet payments are literally what Stripe was built for, so don't be surprised if the "Orb" also prefers Stripe to handle all of its invoicing and payments.


## We've Been Here Before

Wait, we have?

The answer is yes — and several times, actually. The idea of a centralized liquidity provider has been implemented (albeit only partially) via the state.

In the Late Bronze Age (~12th century BC), the leading civilizations of the era <a href =''> Palace Economy </a> of the. The Mycenean Greek stat, and the Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt similarly kept large grain stores to feed their populace in times of famine.

In the Industrial Revolution (19th century AD), Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck of the Prussian Empire created the first welfare state in order to accommodate his rapidly industralizing nation and the rapid structural changes that it brought about.



## Conclusion

Now that we have a basic idea of how the future economy may be oriented, there are still a few questions left un-answered:

- Will each nation have its own sovereign Orb, or will we end up with 2-3 economic blocs similar to the Cold War?
- How will this process by encrypted? Is this a
