From ages 13 to 17, I struggled with a fairly severe eating disorder.

<Gallery images = {images} col = 4 />

I'm writing this for whoever might be going through something similar, or if you're a relative or friend of someone who's going through something similar.

A lot of this is very embarrassing to admit in hindsight — especially from the male perspective. But I hope this will bring some insight into an otherwise elusive condition for most people.


### Causes


**1) Ambition**

I believe many mental disorders are essentially **overflowing ambition, which has latched onto the wrong target**. Anorexics, despite their general low self-esteem, are generally **very competitive** and have an enormous capacity for self-drive and motivation. 

**2) Control**

As a child grows up, the #1 psychological trait that will help them succeed in the long run is **how to deal with things outside their control.** Coaching them in a specific discipline, with all the ups and downs and countless failures, is the best way to prepare any child for the perilous world ahead.



### Inside Their Mind

This obviously differs from person to person — I am simply writing about my specific case.

My brain looked something like this:

The cruel thing is, this crusade never ends. There's always an extension, always another deadline.

It might be mathematics, art, a personal project, or anything else — but having a structured goal to strive towards, which also promises some kind of ultimate reward or social validation at the end, is always a good way to redirect that overflowing mental energy.


### For Relatives and Friends

So what should you do if your relative or friend has anorexia?

This may be somewhat controversial — but I believe the best antidote is to **forcibly redirect their ambition**.

Any attempts to tell the anorexia patient to "relax" and "just let it go" are bound to fail, because their overactive brain will inevitably find another target to latch onto. The only difference between ambition and disorder is what specifically the brain has decided to focus on at the present moment.


### Conclusion

Eating disorders are painful, and unnecessary. 

They can rob years of your life, or even your life itself in many cases. In fact, anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder, most commonly due to secondary psychological effects such as depression and suicide rather than the disorder itself. Starving the body also starves vital bodily functions and is generally a very nasty ordeal.

I hope this may be of help to anyone who may be going through a similar phase.

Let's all recover together!
