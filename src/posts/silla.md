## 1) Sunduk's Coronation


#### Silla, 632 AD.

Just an ordinary day in the kingdom of Silla.

The Silla kingdom was born on

Meanwhile, her husband [**Kim Chunchu (29)**](chunchu) and young son **Bupmin (6**) and daughter **Gotaso (5)** are preparing

Silla is a

Everything in life is determined by one’s rank.

The **Royals** run the affairs of the state, looking after the nation lik ea family.
The **Nobles** dominate politics, the military, and all avenues of public life.
The **6th Ranks** can become officials,
The **5th Rank** was a
The **4th Rank** was. a

Everything below that? Well, the **1st, 2nd**, and **3rd** Ranks may as well as not be human.
You could only really see them in the slave-quarters of rich families.

The Harmony Council convenes to discuss the next king.


> *How about **Prince Chunchu**…?
Chunchu’s mother is a Royal, but his father is a Noble…
In that case, the child becomes a Noble as well.
A strange rule, that one… maybe not the best choice in hindsight.*


> *How about **Princess Sunhwa**…?
Did you forget? We married her off to the King of Baekje years ago!
We could invade Baekje to get her back.
I’m pretty sure they have a “no refunds” policy.*


> *That means there are only 3 Royals left….
**Seungman**, fourty-two of age… niece of the late King. Tall, fair,
**Chunmyung**, fourty-eight of age… mother of Chunchu.
**Dukman**, fourty-eight of age… daughter of the late King. Studious, wise,*


> *Halt! The High Councillor has reached his verdict.*


> *The Royal blood, there remain only three…
The woman king, finally we shall see…
Silla is
May Princess Dukman bring peace to the land…*


> *(Altogether) And so it shall be.*


Munhee’s slave-girl asks if she can attend the coronation.

> *Sorry, girl… the ceremony is for Nobles and Royals only.
You can probably watch from behind the walls, though!*
>

The coronation begins.

Marshal **Yushin (37)**, Munhee’s older brother, is close with Princess Dukman.
He is the leader of the **Hwarang**, an elite training unit for young Noblemen.

> *Are you feeling alright, your majesty?*
>

> *Hm? (startled)*
>

> *Hey, look at me… it’s all going to be alright.
No matter what happens, your loyal servant will always be by your side, until the end.
(smiles)*
>

The Royal Princesses approach and joke with Dukman.

> *Never thought I’d live to see the day when one of us actually became queen…
Yeah, spoiled brat, you’ll let me have a turn on the throne, right? Ha!*
>

The Hwarang Knights, including **🟣 Bidam (27), 🟡 Alchun (27),** and 🟢 **Pumsuk (14),** pledge allegiance to the throne.

> *We, the young Hwarang knights of Silla, pledge eternal allegiance to the Queen!*
>

Finally, Munhee arrives just in time backstage for the coronation.

> *(pant) (pant) the… crown….
Oh… your majesty… congratulations…*
>

At the end of the ceremony, everyone chants for their new queen.

> *Long live the Queen!
Long live the great Hwarang spirit!
Long live Silla!*
>

The young Hwarang Pumsuk (14) hands the young Gotaso (5) a flower.

> *What a cute little girl…*
>

Silla sends envoys to the other kingdoms to let them know of their new queen.

> *So, that old brat Jinpyung is finally dead…
Bah! Good riddance.
Sunhw,kkja’s sister, eh…?*
- **King Mu (51)** of Baekje

> *Le* <br>
**- King Youngryu (49)** of Goguryeo


> *A woman king… those Korean barbarians are at it again, aren’t they?
Wu! Prepare my robes.*
- **Emperor Taizong (34)** of Tang

> *First my aunt, and now Silla as well…?
It must be a new trend.*

## 2) Tournament of Princes

> **Blood is thicker than water.**

**🟨  Baekje, January 632 AD.**

Gyebek was only twelve years old, but he already know how this country worked.

**Prince Euija (32)** is the crown prince, and already has over 10 wives and 15 sons.

The young princes, including  [㊀ ** Buyeo Yung (17**)](yung). ㊁ **Tae (16), ㊂ Hyo (15), ㊃ Yun (12),** and [㊄ ** Buyeo Pung (9**)](pung).

Baekje is dominated by the **8 Great Clans (대성팔족)**, who compete for influence over the king.
They each have a queen, who in turn gives birth to one of the princes.
The clans fight for power in the **Ministers’ Assembly (정사암회의)**, who each control a prince.

> *Prince Tae is already so strong,*
>

> *Well, I guess we’ll see during the tournament tomorrow, won’t we?*
>

> *(smiles) Haha, I guess we will.*
>

As soon as they turn around, they reveal their true feelings.

> *Lying bastards… typical from a Satek.*
>

> *Just like father said… never lose face against a Yunbi…!*
>

The young princes are having a tournament, to train them for a warrior life.
The families each sponsor their prince over the others.

> *Prince **Yung**, the first-born.
The **Satek** clan always gets picked first for everything… if you’re ever wondering why, he’s the reason.*
>

> *Prince **Tae**, the second-born.
I’m surprised the **Baek** clan got the second one!*
>

> *Prince **Hyo**, the third-born.
The **Yunbi** clan did pretty well with that one, didn’t they?*
>

융 왕자, 태자의 장남

역시 사택씨 가문은 눈도 빠르지, 태자의 장남을 낳다니… 벌써 왕족은 보장이여.

태 왕자, 태자의 차남.

와, 백씨 가문이 차남 자리를 차지했어? 역시 사비성 토박이들은 다르다니깐.

효 왕자, 태자의 3남.

연비 가문도 많이 컸네, 3남을 낳은 걸 보면. 잘하면 왕족도 될 수 있겠어.

Seung, age twelve, shows up out of nowhere and wins first place in the tournament.
He is clearly the strongest boy, but the onlookers ignore him because he is not owned by one of the Great Clans.

> *Who’s that boy? Is he one of the princes?*
>

> *No, I think he’s one of the king’s nephews or something…*
>

> *Which clan owns him?*
>

> *I don’t even know…
Tsk, tsk… I was hoping Prince Hyo would win. Oh, well.*
>

After the tournament, Prince Pung (9) comes to congratulate Seung.

> *Hey, that was awesome back there!*
>

> *What? Oh, thanks.*
>

> *What was that last technique? Could you teach me?*
>

> *Oh, sure! That was—*
>

Lady Mokli suddenly calls from the back.

> *Buyeo Pung!*
>

> *Aw, crap. My mom is calling me.
Hey, I’ll talk to you later! Awesome stuff.*
>

Seung retreats back to his friends.

> *Hey, did you hear? Silla has a new king… and it’s a woman!*
>

> *Whoa, no way. I guess they’re really running out of Royals, huh?*
>

Euija complains about the clans after the tournament.

> *All these bickering clans… I’m not even king yet, and they’re already starting to get on my nerves.
I mean, they’re **my** sons, aren’t they?
Yet these families keep acting like they own them, like I’m nothing at all.*
>

Suddenly, Seung runs into Euija.

> *My name is Seung! I think you’re my distant uncle or something…*
>

> *Yeah, well, I’ve got a lot of relatives, kid.
Hey, aren’t you the kid that won the tournament? Those were some serious moves.
Who’s your mother? Which clan are you from?*
>

> *I don’t know.*
>

> *Hm?*
>

> *I don’t know… she wasn’t from some big important family.*
>

> *Really…
Ha, those old clan geezers must be super angry that you beat all their precious little sons!
Twelve years old, eh? Isn’t it about time you received your adult name?
I’m thinking… **Gyebek**.*
>

아니, 사비성으로 천도한 후로, 왕권이 계속 사택씨와 연비씨에 의해 흔들리지 않습니까.

내가 왕인가, 사택 공이 왕인가?

내 아들들인가, 대성팔족의 첩자들인가?

너의 이름으로… 계백 어떻냐?

## 7) Daeya Fortress

> **봄에는 여자가 쇠 저를 녹이고,
가을에는 남자가 쇠 판을 뚫는다. <br>
In spring, a woman may melt a steel sword.
In autumn, a man may impale a steel shield.**
>

**🔵  Silla, August 642 AD.**



Daeya Fortress is on the Silla-Baekje border, far away from the capital.

The local soldiers hear of news that the young Pumsuk has been named as the general of Daeya Fortress.

> *Typical stupidity from the capital…
“Let’s put a young kid in his 20’s as the leader! It’s OK BeCauSe he’s a NoBLe, riGhT?”
God, I’ve had it with this stupid country.*
>

> *I heard he’s Prince Chunchu’s son-in-law, too!*
>

> *HA! You couldn’t make it up if you tried.*
>

> *Hey, I’m still a 5th Rank, while you’re 4th Rank.
Watch your tone before you speak to me, peasant!*
>

Gumil’s wife is an incredibly beautiful woman.

> *A Hwarang, eh…? Must be a healthy young man.*
>

At a feast, Gumil’s wife seduces Pumsuk.

> *Well… I’ve just recently married, you see.
She’s Prince Chunchu’s daughter.
Technically, I’m not even supposed to be worthy of speaking to her,*
>

> *Ah, born out of true love, I’m sure.*
>

> *Well, to be honest, I don’t really know her that well…
But I’m still a Hwarang.*
>

> *It must be so difficult, pretending to love that spoiled young rich girl…*
>

> *Watch your mouth, peasant girl…. don’t talk to Prince Chunchu’s daughter like that!
She may not be a true Royal, but she is still the Queen’s grand-niece.*
>

> *Oh, spoken like a real Noble man, so formal…
Yes, a Noble man could never look at a low rank girl like me…
Yes, I may be a low rank girl…
… but does that little Noble girl of yours have these?*
>

> *(Gulp)*
>

When Gumil returns, he finds his wife pregnant — although he has been away for months.

> *Who was it…?*
>

> *I- I told him that a Noble man wasn’t supposed to touch a girl like me…
(sobs)*
>

Yunchung launches the invasion

Gumil burns the storage fortress, angered by the his general’s betrayal.

Pumsuk decides to kill himself and Gotaso to save her.

>

A messenger rushes to the Silla capital to deliver the news.

> *Daeya has been captured by Baekje…!*
>

> *WHAT? What about Pumsuk?*
>

> *What about Gotaso?!*
>

> *Pumsuk and Gotaso are both dead…!
The general killed both the princess* & *himself after learning of the fall of the fortress…
The*
>

The entire Royal family stands there, speechless.

In his room, Chunchu swears revenge.

> *Pumsuk… you’re lucky you killed yourself before I could get to you.
Euija…  barely one year as king, and you’ve already made the worst decision of your life.
Baekje… you’ve sealed your fate on this night.*
