### (一) Sunduk’s Coronation

**Silla, January 632 AD.**

**Munhee (22)** is a young noblewoman, being attended by her low-rank servants. 
She is getting her hair done for an important event, while a servant takes care of her baby son **Inmun (3)**.

Come on, boy, can’t you find something better?*
**- Munhee**

Meanwhile, her husband **Chunchu (29)** and young son **Bupmin (6**) and daughter **Gotaso (5)** are preparing.

There are now only 3 Royals left — 🌸 **Princess Dukman (37),** 🌼 **Princess Seungman (32)**, and **🌹 Princess Chunmyung (49).**

The **Harmony** **Council (화백회의)**, the ruling body of Nobles, debate who the next king should be.

> *How about **Prince Chunchu**…?
Chunchu’s mother is a Royal, but his father is a Noble…
In that case, the child becomes a Noble as well.*
> 

> *How about **Princess Sunhwa**…?
Did you forget? We married her off to the King of Baekje years ago!
We could invade Baekje to get her back.
I’m pretty sure they have a “no refunds” policy.*
> 

> *The Royal blood, there remain only three…
The woman king, finally we shall see…*
- **High Councillor**
>
